# Introduction to R
Some exercises and tutorials for the class **Introduction to R**, held at Almo Collegio Borromeo, Pavia, Italy, from 11th November 2020.


## Getting started
The project was designed for R 4.0+ and is based on `renv`.
To get started, from an R console, run:
``` r
renv::restore()
```

All the required packages will be automatically installed. 
Now, you can simply go to one of the folders starting with two digits, select the R Markdown file and run it!

It is strongly suggested to follow the order of the tutorials.
